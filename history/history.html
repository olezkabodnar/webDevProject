                <li>n the early 1960s, Jawa invented the first automatic clutch for motorcycles.
                     The centrifugal clutch was designed for Jawa 250/559 and 350/360.
                     Because the clutch has been patented worldwide by Jawa and it was copied in the Honda 50 Cub motorcycle, 
                    Honda had to retreat, pay a fine, and pay a license fee for each motorcycle sold.</li>

                    500 OHC and the 50 Pioner and Jawetta mopeds. A powerful two-stroke motorcycle known as the JAWA 250/350 with 
                    the compact engine, rear suspension and many other innovations was exported to more than 120 countries. 
                    It was one of the most successful models of JAWA.</li>

            <ul class="events-list">
                <li>Due to the economic recession of the early 1930s, a cheaper and simpler motorcycle was needed. 
                    The year 1932 marked the introduction of JAWA 175, with its 3.6-kW engine. 
                    This light (70 kg) machine was capable of speeds up to 80 km/h and fuel consumption of 3.5 L/100 km. 
                    The first year of production was an immediate success, selling over 3000 of the JAWA 175, 
                    almost three times the number of the 500-cc model over three years of production. 
                    The production of this model ended in 1946. In 1938, JAWA was the first to offer test rides during exhibition shows.
                     This test motorcycle was a custom JAWA 175 equipped with dual handlebars, a second pair in the back for the instructor.
                      Over the years, 27,535 units of the JAWA 175 were built.</li>

            <strong>Origin-1930</strong>
            <ul class="events-list">
                <li>Frantisek Janecek started the company after working in the armament industry.
                     Although he did not have experience with motorcycles, he was familiar with production techniques. 
                     Janecek chose between the Austrian double piston two-stroke motor of Puch, the Berlin two-stroke of Schliha, 
                     and the new Wanderer 500cc. Janecek chose the Wanderer. Because of the collapse of the German motor industry, 
                     Wanderer had stopped production, being unable to compete with BMW. The first model was introduced on October 23, 
                     1929. This was a 500cc four-cycle engine with 12 kW of power (18 hp) and fuel consumption of 6 L/100 km. 
                     Although priced highly, through the first years (and several constructional fixes), 
                     this motorcycle was successful and was considered reliable.</li>
