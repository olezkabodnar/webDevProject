                    <p class="text">JAWA is a motorcycle and moped manufacturer founded in Prague, Czechoslovakia in 1929 by Frantisek Janecek, who bought the motorcycle division of Wanderer. 
                    The name JAWA was established by concatenating the first letters of Janecek and Wanderer. In the past, especially in the 1950s, JAWA was one of the top motorcycle manufacturers and exported its 350 model to over 120 countries.
                    The best known model was the 350 Perak, and in the 1970s the 350 Californian. It appeared in typical black and red coloring from the US to New Zealand. After 1990 a significant loss of production occurred. A successor company was formed in 1997 in Tynec nad Sazavou, continuing the name as JAWA Moto.
                    In the Indian market the brand JAWA Motorcycles was resurrected in December 2018 by Classic Legends, which is owned by Mahindra & Mahindra, through a licensing deal with the original Czech company JAWA Moto.</p>
